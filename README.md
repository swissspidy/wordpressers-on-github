# WordPressers on GitHub

Show WordPress.org profiles for users on GitHub. Makes it very easy to find WordPress contributors on WordPress.org if they use different usernames on the two platforms.

Everywhere you see their username on GitHub, you'll see a small WordPress logo with a link to their WordPress.org profile next to it. Hover over the logo to quickly see their username in a tooltip. Similarly, visit someone's GitHub profile and a link to their WordPress.org profile will appear in their bio.
